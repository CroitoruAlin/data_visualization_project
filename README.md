# data_visualization_project
Final project for Data Visualization class


In the most recent versions of the FIFA game, when a gamer plays in career mode he/she has the option to negotiate the wage of the players and if it is under player expectation then he becomes angry/upset and rejects any other offer from your club. On the other hand, if the wage is too large then your club will have problem with the budget. 

This project aims to help gamers identify what would be a suitable offer when negotiating a contract within the FIFA game, so that their offer does not offend or overestimate the player. 

We plan to create interesting plots that explain correlations between features in an easy to understand and engaging way.  

Throughout our exploration we will analyze different relations between features, create hypotheses and design models to test our hypotheses. In the end we will compare our hypotheses and the results from our modelâ€™s predictions.
